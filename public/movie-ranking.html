<h1>The Best Movies According to Anchita</h1>

<h2> My top 3 movies of all-time </h2>

<hr />

<h3> Avartar </h3>
<p> This is my favourite movie since it have very vivid and fantastic images. All the creatures and environment on Pandora is a breath taking view. I really respect James Cameron's imagination.</p>

<h3> John Wick</h3>
<p> The best action movie everrrrr. This movie did not have much cgi and the actor really can do some action moves. The story is also good with a lot of mystery, especially the history of the org. and the Continental Hotel.</p>

<h3> Iron man </h3>
<p> This is the first marvel movie i've have watched and its was phenomenal story with great cgi. All the technology of Stark corp and the acting of Robert Downey Jr. are very interesting. </p>
